# Elastic Stack on Docker

This configuration is based on the [Elastic demo](https://github.com/elastic/examples/tree/master/Miscellaneous/docker).


## Getting Started

1. Docker version > v17.07.0 (Earlier versions may work but have not been tested)
1. Docker-Compose > 1.15.0
1. Ensuring the following ports are free on the host, as they are mounted by the containers:

    - `80` (nginx)
    - `5601` (Kibana)
    - `9200` (Elasticsearch)
    - `3306` (MySQL)

1. At least 3GB of available RAM for Docker

The example file uses docker-compose v2 syntax.

To start the configuration: `docker-compose up`

To remove the configuration: `docker-compose down -v`

To check the status: `docker ps -a`
Note the `configure_stack` container will have exited on completion of the configuration of stack. This occurs before the Beats containers start.  Other containers should be "Up".

On confirming the stack is started, navigate to Kibana at [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601).


## Demo

The majority of the dashboards will simply populate due to inherent "noise" caused by the images. However, we do expose a few additional ports for interaction to allow unique generation.

1. Show the setup and start the stack.
1. Show `filebeat-*` (including Docker logs and others) in Discover in Kibana. Any activity to the docker containers, including requests to Kibana, are logged. These logs are captured in JSON form and indexed into a index `filebeat-docker-<yyyy.mm.dd>`.
1. Show Metricbeat dashboards for Docker and processes.
1. Show the Heartbeat dashboard.
1. Show the Packetbeat flow and HTTP dashboards and generate some HTTP requests on [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80). Currently we donâ€™t host any content in nginx so requests will result in 404s.
1. Generate MySQL queries: `mysqlslap --concurrency=5 --iterations=4 --number-int-cols=2 --number-char-cols=3 --auto-generate-sql --host=127.0.0.1 --user root -p`
1. See the Metricbeat and Packetbeat dashboards for MySQL.
1. TSVB on the Metricbeat index: `docker.network.in` vs `docker.network.out` and split up by `docker.container.name`.


## Architecture

The following containers are deployed:

* `Elasticsearch`
* `Kibana`
* `Auditbeat` Collect security and file integrity events.
* `Filebeat` Collecting logs from the nginx and MySQL containers. Also responsible for indexing the host's system and Docker logs.
* `Heartbeat` Pinging all other containers over ICMP. Additionally monitoring Elasticsearch, Kibana, and nginx over HTTP. Monitoring MySQL over TCP.
* `Metricbeat` - Monitoring nginx and MySQL containers using status check interfaces. Additionally, used to monitor the host system with respect CPU, disk, memory, and network. Monitors the host's Docker statistics with respect to disk, CPU, health checks, memory, and network.
* `Packetbeat` Monitoring communication between all containers with respect to HTTP, flows, DNS, and MySQL.
* `nginx` - Supporting container for Filebeat (access & error logs) and Metricbeat (server-status).
* `MySQL` - Supporting container for Filebeat (slow & error logs), Metricbeat (status), and Packetbeat data.

In addition to the above containers, a `configure_stack` container is deployed at startup.  This is responsible for inserting custom templates and ingest pipelines. This container uses the Metricbeat images as it contains all required dependencies.


## Modules & Data

The following Beats modules are utilised in this stack example to provide data and dashboards:

1. Auditbeat
    - `auditd` monitoring Linux kernel events
    - `file_integrity` checking changes in the folders `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr/sbin`, `/etc`

1. Heartbeat
    - `http` monitoring nginx (80), Kibana (5601), Elasticsearch (9200)
    - `tcp` monitoring MySQL (3306)
    - `icmp` monitoring all containers

1. Filebeat
    - `system` module with `syslog` metricset
    - `mysql` module with `access` and `slowlog` `metricsets`
    - `nginx` module with `access` and `error` `metricsets`

1. Metricbeat
    - `docker` module with `container`, `cpu`, `diskio`, `healthcheck`, `info`, `memory`, `network` metricsets
    - `mysql` module with `status` metricset
    - `nginx` module with `stubstatus` metricset
    - `system` module with `core`,`cpu`,`load`,`diskio`,`filesystem`,`fsstat`,`memory`,`network`,`process`,`socket`, top 20 processes

1. Packetbeat, capturing traffic on all interfaces:
    - `dns` - port `53`
    - `http` - ports `80`, `5601`, `9200`
    - `icmp`
    - `flows`
    - `mysql` - port `3306`


## Technical Notes

The following summarises some important technical considerations:

1. The Elasticsearch instances uses a named volume `esdata` for data persistence between restarts. It exposes HTTP port 9200 for communication with other containers.
1. Environment variable defaults can be found in the file `.env`, which include the version of the Elastic Stack.
1. The Elasticsearch container has its memory limited to 1GB. This can be adjusted using the environment parameter `ES_MEM_LIMIT`. Elasticsearch has a heap size of 512MB. This can be adjusted through the environment variable `ES_JVM_HEAP` and should be set to 50% of the `ES_MEM_LIMIT`.
1. The Kibana container exposes the port 5601.
1. All configuration files can be found in the extracted folder `./config`.
1. In order for the containers `nginx` and `mysql` to share their logs with the Filebeat container, they mount the folder `./logs` relative to the extracted directory. Filebeat additionally mounts this directory to read the logs.
1. The Filebeat container mounts the host directories `/private/var/log` (OS X) in order to read the host's system logs.
1. The Filebeat container mounts the host directory `/var/lib/docker/containers` in order to access the container logs.  These are ingested using a custom prospector and processed by an ingest pipeline loaded by the container `configure_stack`.
1. The Filebeat registry file is persisted to the named volume `filebeatdata`, thus avoiding data duplication during restarts.
1. In order to collect Docker statistics, the Beats containers mount the hosts `/var/run/docker.sock` directory.  For OS X this directory exists on the VM hosting docker.
1. Packetbeat is configured to use the hosts network, in order to capture traffic on the host system rather than that between the containers.
1. For data persistence between restarts the `mysql` container uses a named volume `mysqldata`.
1. The nginx and MySQL containers expose ports 80 and 3306 respectively on the host. **Ensure these ports are free prior to starting**
1. For OS X the stats of the VM hosting docker will be reported. This allows Metricbeat to use the `system` module report on disk, memory, network, and CPU of the host.
1. In for Filebeat to index the docker logs it mounts `/var/lib/docker/containers`. These JSON logs are ingested into the index Filebeat index's pattern name, but under a different index (`filebeat-docker-<yyyy.mm.dd>`).
1. On systems with POSIX file permissions, all Beats configuration files are subject to ownership and file permission checks. The purpose of these checks is to prevent unauthorized users from providing or modifying configurations that are run by the Beat. The owner of the configuration file must be either root or the user who is executing the Beat process. The permissions on the file must disallow writes by anyone other than the owner. As we mount our configurations from the host, where the user is likely different than that used to run the container and the beat process, we disable this check for all beats with `-strict.perms=false`.
